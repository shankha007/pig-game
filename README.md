# Pig Game

There will be two players who are going to roll dice. The first player to score 100 wins.

## How to Play

The game starts with player one. Each time a player rolls 1, the control will be passed to the other player. If a player rolls any dice other than 1 it will be added to their temporary score. This temporary score will be added to their actual score when the player clicks on 'Hold'. When the player clicks 'Hold', the control will be passed to the other player.

Click on 'Roll Dice' to roll a dice for next round.

If a player has scored a good temporary score and on the next round he/she rolls 1, the temporary score will be reset and the actual score will remain unchanged and the control will be passed on too to the other player.

Click on 'New Game' to start a brand game. It will reset the game totally at any situation.
